## About the Project
This website is a fully responsive replica of the Chase Bank Website. With all the rows and columns present, it was a perfect website to showcase my CSS skills!!!

It also demonstrates my attention to detail. Give me a design and I can implement it! 🫡

👉 Here is the [original](https://www.chase.com/) (there may be different variations of the homepage)

⬇️ And down below is a snapshot of my project (I won't deploy for risk of getting in trouble 👮‍♀️)

## Built With:
- Plain HTML
- CSS flexbox and grid
